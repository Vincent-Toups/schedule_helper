Scheduling Assistant
====================

This is a very simple Javascript app (with no back end) which allows
the developer to describe a series of events which need to be
scheduled (and for which valid dates may interdepend) in the form of a
spreadsheet. Once described, the application presents the user with an
interface allowing them to schedule the events appropriately. 

They user may copy a link which stores the state of the UI so that
they can come back to it in the future.
